Here is I have intregated the paypal getway in core php
PayPal Smart Payment Buttons
Simple and quick integration for one-time payments.

How it works:
1.Include PayPal JavaScript SDK.
2.Configure the buttons to create and capture orders using client-side JavaScript.
3.No server-side SDK required, but you can validate the payment with PHP.
